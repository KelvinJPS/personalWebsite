# About me 

My name is Kelvin. I come from Venezuela, and I currently live in the US. I speak 3 languages Spanish, English and French. My main interests are technology, language learning, and fiction/culture. I enjoy fiction in various languages and media, such as Spanish, French, and English. 
For example, I enjoy the format of series, as well as anime, novels, Webtoons, comics, and manga.
I also like philosophy; I have primarily explored Stoicism and existentialism. The books "Meditations" by Marcus Aurelius and "L'Ã‰tranger" by Albert Camus are good books to start gaining an idea of these philosophies.

## The purpose of this website

Sometimes, I feel like I have been wasting my time these last few years, the  time keeps passing but still I have nothing to show for, the reason of this website is that, I want it  to be a place where
I can put the stuff I build and learn, so then in the future I'm able too look back and say yeah I did this, this what I have been investing my time.

## Recap of my last projects.

OK it's not like, I have completely wasted my time these last 3-4 years, I learned English (Still learning), 
Finished the [CS50](https://github.com/KelvinJPS/CS50) course, failed building an app [FocusOne](https://github.com/KelvinJPS/FocusOne-Win-Desktop), previous version the now deprecated [UWP framework](https://github.com/KelvinJPS/todolist-uwp).

It was a desktop app that, where the goal was to help the user focus for a period of time, by letting them to select the helpful apps for the task at hand and blocking everything else, my mistake was to try to build every single todo app feature of the competition, and the project became unmaintainable in terms of design I was not able to fit the other's app design into mine, and coding every time I fixed a bug it made it impossible to me to add more features.

then I did a bunch of toy projects, scripts, and did a bunch of solutions to
coding problems for practice

# The plan forward 

I want to start actually being able to finish more projects, and there is a lot of things that I want to learn,  The plan forward is to start being more detailed in what I want to do from the projects I built and use this website for accountability
